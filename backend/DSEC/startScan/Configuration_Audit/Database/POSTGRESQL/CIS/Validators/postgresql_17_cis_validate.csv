(1 row) 
Now, we use GRANT to configure each DBA role to allow it to use the set_user 
functions. In the example below, we will configure my db user doug. (You would do this 
for each DBA's normal user role.) 
postgres=# grant execute on function set_user(text) to doug; 
GRANT 
postgres=# grant execute on function set_user_u(text) to doug; 
GRANT 
Connect to PostgreSQL as yourself and verify it works as expected:

# whoami 
psql 
# psql -U doug -d postgres -h 127.0.0.1 
postgres=> select set_user('postgres'); 
ERROR:  switching to superuser not allowed 
HINT:  Use 'set_user_u' to escalate. 
postgres=> select set_user_u('postgres'); 
 set_user_u ------------ 
 OK 
(1 row) 
postgres=# select current_user, session_user; 
 current_user | session_user --------------+-------------- 
 postgres     | doug

postgres=# select reset_user();

 OK 
(1 row) 
postgres=> select current_user, session_user; 
 current_user | session_user --------------+-------------- 
 doug         | doug 
(1 row) 
Once all DBA's normal user accounts have been GRANTed permission, revoke the ability 
to login as the postgres (superuser) user: 
postgres=# ALTER USER postgres NOLOGIN; 
ALTER ROLE 
Which results in: 
$ psql 
psql: FATAL:  role ""postgres"" is not permitted to log in 
$ psql -U doug -d postgres -h 127.0.0.1 
psql (1*.0) 
Revoke SUPERUSER and/or LOGIN from any other roles that were previously 
identified: 
postgres=# ALTER USER usera NOSUPERUSER; -- revoke superuser 
ALTER ROLE 
postgres=# ALTER USER usera NOLOGIN; -- revoke login 
ALTER ROLE 
postgres=# ALTER USER usera NOSUPERUSER NOLOGIN; -- revoke both at once 
ALTER ROLE 
Note that we show dropping the privileges both individually and as one. Pick an 
appropriate version based on your application/business needs. 
Remove any escalated privileges on users granted indirectly that were previously 
identified using the roletree view:

postgres=# REVOKE name_of_granting_role FROM bob; -- an example only 
REVOKE ROLE

"5.2 Ensure PostgreSQL is Bound to an IP Address				",s,s,s,"By default, listen_addresses is set to localhost which prevents any and all remote TCP connections to the PostgreSQL port. Some Docker images may set listen_addesses to *, which corresponds to all available IP interfaces; thus, the PostgreSQL server then accepts TCP connections on all the container's/server's IPv6 and IPv4 interfaces. (The same is true for a setting of 0.0.0.0.) You can make this configuration more restrictive by setting the listen_addresses configuration option to a specific list of IPv4 or IPv6 address so that the server only accepts TCP connections on those addresses. This parameter can only be set at server start.","To have the PostgreSQL server only accept connections on a specific IP address, add 
an entry similar to this in the PostgreSQL configuration file postgresql.conf: 

listen_addresses = '<your IP>'
 
To listen on multiple addresses, a comma-separated list may be used:
 
listen_addresses = '<your first IP>, <your second IP>' 

In this case, clients can connect to the server using --host=<your IP>, while 
connections on other server host addresses are not possible. "
"6.2 Ensure 'backend' runtime parameters are configured correctly				",s,s,s,"In order to serve multiple clients efficiently, the PostgreSQL server launches a new ""backend"" process for each client. The runtime parameters in this benchmark section are controlled by the backend process. The server's performance, in the form of slow queries causing a denial of service, and the RDBM's auditing abilities for determining root cause analysis can be potentially compromised via these parameters.","Once detected, the unauthorized/undesired change can be corrected by altering the 
configuration file and executing a server restart. In the case where the parameter has 
been specified on the command-line invocation of pg_ctl the restart invocation is 
insufficient and an explicit stop and start must instead be made. 

1. Query the view pg_settings and compare with previous query outputs for any 
changes. 
2. Review configuration files postgresql.conf and postgresql.auto.conf and 
compare them with previously archived file copies for any changes. 
3. Examine the process output and look for parameters that were used at server 
startup: 
ps -few | grep -E -- '[p]ost.*-[D]' 
4. Examine the contents of $PGDATA/postmaster.opts"
"6.7 Ensure FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL Cryptography Is Used				",s,s,s,"Install, configure, and use OpenSSL on a platform that has a NIST certified FIPS 140-2 installation of OpenSSL.

cryptographic modules. To configure OpenSSL to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, see the 
official RHEL Documentation. Below is a general summary of the steps required: 
To switch the system to FIPS mode in RHEL 9: 
# whoami

# fips-mode-setup --enable 
Kernel initramdisks are being regenerated. This might take some time. 
Setting system policy to FIPS 
Note: System-wide crypto policies are applied on application start-up. 
It is recommended to restart the system for the change of policies 
to fully take place. 
FIPS mode will be enabled. 
Please reboot the system for the setting to take effect. 
Restart your system to allow the kernel to switch to FIPS mode: 
# whoami 
root 
# reboot 
After the restart, you can check the current state of FIPS mode: 
# whoami 
root 
# fips-mode-setup --check

For instance, RSA does not provide PFS, while the ECDHE (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) and DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) provides PFS. ECDHE is the stronger protocol and should be preferred, while DHE may be allowed for greater compatibility with older clients.

8.2 Ensure the backup and restore tool,s,s,s,"pgBackRest aims to be a simple, reliable backup and restore system that can seamlessly scale up to the largest databases and workloads. Instead of relying on traditional backup tools like tar and rsync, pgBackRest implements all backup features internally and uses a custom protocol for communicating with remote systems. Removing reliance on tar and rsync allows for better solutions to database-specific backup challenges. The custom remote protocol allows for more flexibility and limits the types of connections that are required to perform a backup which increases security.","pgBackRest is not installed nor configured for PostgreSQL by default, but instead is 
maintained as a GitHub project. Fortunately, it is a part of the PGDG repository and can 
be easily installed: 
# whoami

Once installed, pgBackRest must be configured for things like stanza name, backup 
location, retention policy, logging, etc. Please consult the configuration guide. 
If employing pgBackRest for your backup/recovery solution, ensure the repository, base 
backups, and WAL archives are stored on a reliable file system separate from the 
database server. Further, the external storage system where backups reside should 
have limited access to only those system administrators as necessary. Finally, as with 
any backup/recovery solution, stringent testing must be conducted. A backup is only 
good if it can be restored successfully. "
