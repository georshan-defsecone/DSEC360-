1.1,Ensure DNS server is configured,"Fortinet uses the Domain Name Service (DNS) to translate host names into IP addresses. 
To enable DNS lookups, you must specify the primary DNS server for your system. 
You can also specify secondary and tertiary DNS servers. 
When resolving host names, the system consults the primary name server. 
If a failure or time-out occurs, the system consults the secondary name server. 
For security purpose, trusted DNS servers should be configured to prevent man-in-the middle attacks. ",PASS,"Primary: 96.45.45.45
Secondary: 96.45.46.46",
2.1.1,Ensure 'Pre-Login Banner' is set,"Configure a pre-login banner, ideally approved by the organization’s legal team. 
This banner should, at minimum, prohibit unauthorized access, provide notice of logging or monitoring, and avoid using the word “welcome” or similar words of invitation. ",FAIL,Pre-Login-Banner: disable,"Reason:
    Pre-Login-Banner is set to 'disable', but it must be 'enable'

Remediation:
    Run the following command in the CLI to enable the pre-login-banner: 
        FG1 # config system global  
        FG1 (global) # set pre-login-banner enable 
        FG1 (global) # end

    In the GUI, to edit the content of the pre-login disclaimer message: 
        1. Go to 'System' -> 'Replacement Messages' -> 'Extended View' -> 'Pre-login Disclaimer Message'. 
        The edit screen is on the bottom right corner of the page. 
        Click on ""Save"" after the editing is done."

This is equivalent to Message of the Day (MOTD) in some other systems.",FAIL,Post-Login-Banner: disable,"Reason:
    Post-Login-Banner is set to 'disable', but it must be 'enable'

Remediation:
    Run the following command in the CLI to enable the post-login-banner:

2.1.4,Ensure correct system time is configured through NTP,"You can either manually set the FortiOS system time, or configure the device to automatically keep its system time correct by synchronizing with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. 
These settings enable the use of primary and secondary NTP servers to provide redundancy in case of a failure involving the primary NTP server.",FAIL,"Type: fortiguard, NTP Sync: enable, Servers: Not Found","Reason:
    NTP type is not 'custom'; No NTP servers are configured

Remediation:
    You can only customize NTP setting using CLI. 
    In this example, we'll assign pool.ntp.org as primary NTP server and 1.1.1.1 as secondary NTP server. 

        FGT1 # config system ntp 
        FGT1 (ntp) # set type custom 
        FGT1 (ntp) # config ntpserver

Remediation:
    Can be modified from CLI or GUI. 

    From CLI, do the following: 
        config system password-policy 
             set status enable 
             set apply-to admin-password ipsec-preshared-key

    Or from GUI, do the following: 
        1) Log in to FortiGate as Super Admin   
        2) Go to 'System' > 'Settings' 
        3) Find the 'Password Policy' section 
        4) Default 'Password scope' is 'Off', change it to 'Both'

        9)' and 'Special' 
        8) Disable 'Allow password reuse' 
        9) Enable 'Password expiration' and set it to 90"
2.2.2,Ensure administrator password retries and lockout time are configured ,"Failed login attempts can indicate malicious attempts to gain access to your network. 
To prevent this security risk, FortiGate is preconfigured to limit the number of failed administrator login attempts. 
After the maximum number of failed login attempts is reached, access to the account is blocked for the configured lockout period.",FAIL,"admin-lockout-threshold: 3
admin-lockout-duration: 60","Reason:
    admin-lockout-duration is not set to 900

Remediation:
    To configure the lockout options, from CLI: 

        config system global 
            set admin-lockout-threshold 3 
            set admin-lockout-duration 900
