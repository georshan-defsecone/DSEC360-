1.1.2.1.1,Ensure /tmp is a separate partition,"The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
and some applications.
- IF - an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in
systemd default unit file.
Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI,
entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence.
/tmp can be configured to use tmpfs.
tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to
accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap
space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o
remount.
Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be
shown as ""Shmem"" in /proc/meminfo and ""Shared"" in free. Notice that these
counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using
df and du.
tmpfs has three mount options for sizing:
• size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of
your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the
machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that
memory.
• nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE.
• nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half
of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the
number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower.
These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size
parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your
physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%",/tmp is not mounted separately,FAIL,"First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at
boot time.

/etc/fstab.
Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options:

2.4.1.8,Ensure crontab is restricted to authorized users,"crontab is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron
daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in
/var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly.
If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in
order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but
the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny
file in order to use this command.
If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration
parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be
able to use this command.
If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that
/etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow
in order to be able to use the crontab.
Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always
allowed to setup a crontab.
The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world-
readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to
all users until the permissions are fixed.
There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs
directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure
that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only
syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the
directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the
setgid bid set for that specific group.
Note:
• Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run
as that user
• The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls
administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron
jobs",: /etc/cron.allow does not exist,FAIL,"- IF - cron is installed on the system:

5.1.7,Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured,"Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections
from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An
idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally,
the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that
caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect
idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused
disconnect idle users.
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout
of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config:
• ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data
has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the
encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0,
indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.
• ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be
sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this
threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will
disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use
of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive
messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be
spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable.
The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on
knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If
ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default,
unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.
Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.","- One or both values are missing or set to 0:

aide.conf is case-sensitive. Leading and trailing white spaces are ignored. Each
config lines must end with new line.
AIDE uses the backslash character \ as escape character for ' ' (space), '@' and ''
(backslash) (e.g. '\ ' or '@'). To literally match a '' in a file path with a regular expression
you have to escape the backslash twice (i.e. '\\').
There are three types of lines in aide.conf:
• The configuration options which are used to set configuration parameters and
define groups.
• (restricted) rules that are used to indicate which files are added to the database.
• Macro lines define or undefine variables within the config file.
Note: Lines beginning with # are ignored as comments.
@@include <FILE> - Include <FILE>.
• The content of the file is used as if it were inserted in this part of the config file.
• The maximum depth of nested includes is 16.
`@@include <DIRECTORY> <REGEX> - [RULE_PREFIX] (added in AIDE v0.17)
• Include all (regular) files found in <DIRECTORY> matching regular expression
<REGEX> (sub-directories are ignored).
• The file are included in lexical sort order.
• If RULE_PREFIX is set, all rules included by the statement are prefixed with given
<RULE_PREFIX> (added in AIDE v0.18). Prefixes from nested include
statements are concatenated.
• The content of the files is used as if it were inserted in this part of the config file.
@x_include:
• is identical to @@include, except that if a config file is executable is is run and
the output is used as config.
• If the executable file exits with status greater than zero or writes to stderr aide
stops with an error.
• For security reasons <DIRECTORY> and each executable config file must be
owned by the current user or root. They must not be group- or world-writable.
