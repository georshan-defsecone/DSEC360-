1.1.1,1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Enforce password history,PasswordHistorySize,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand- alone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s)."
1.1.2,"1.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days, but not 0' (Automated)",Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Maximum password age,MaximumPasswordAge,local_group_policy,"This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0."
1.1.3,1.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password age,MinimumPasswordAge,local_group_policy,This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days. The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s)).
1.1.4,1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password length,MinimumPasswordLength,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps ""passphrase"" is a better term than ""password."" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as ""I want to drink a $5 milkshake"" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s)."
1.1.5,1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements,PasswordComplexity,local_group_policy,"This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: • Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters • Be at least six characters in length • Contain characters from three of the following categories: o English uppercase characters (A through Z) o English lowercase characters (a through z) o Base 10 digits (0 through 9) o Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) o A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as ""!"" or ""@"". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
1.1.6,1.1.6 (L1) Ensure 'Relax minimum password length limits' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated),HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SAM,RelaxMinimumPasswordLengthLimits,registry,"This policy setting determines whether the minimum password length setting can be increased beyond the legacy limit of 14 characters. For more information, please see the following Microsoft Security Blog. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
1.1.7,1.1.7 (L1) Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Store passwords using reversible encryption,ClearTextPassword,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the passwords. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
1.2.1,1.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout duration' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Account lockout duration,LockoutDuration,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them. Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer. The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s)."
1.2.2,"1.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0' (Automated)",Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Account lockout threshold,LockoutBadCount,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is locked. Setting this policy to 0 does not conform to the benchmark as doing so disables the account lockout threshold. The recommended state for this setting is: 5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0."
1.2.3,1.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Administrator account lockout' is set to 'Enabled' (Manual),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Account Lockout Policies\Allow Administrator account lockout,AllowAdminLockout,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines whether the built-in Administrator account is subject to the following Account Lockout Policy settings: Account lockout duration, Account lockout threshold, and Reset account lockout counter. By default, this account is excluded from the account lockout controls and will never be locked out with repeated bad password attempts. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
1.2.4,1.2.4 (L1) Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Reset account lockout counter after,ResetLockoutCount,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting. If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically. The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s)."
2.2.1,2.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller' is set to 'No One' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller,AccessCredentialManager,local_group_policy,"This security setting is used by Credential Manager during Backup and Restore. No accounts should have this user right, as it is only assigned to Winlogon. Users' saved credentials might be compromised if this user right is assigned to other entities. The recommended state for this setting is: No One."

Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services or IIS also require this user right. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Users."
2.2.6,"2.2.6 (L1) Ensure 'Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users' (Automated)",Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services,SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a Remote Desktop Services client. If your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user right through Group Policy. If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user right only to the Administrators group or use the Restricted Groups feature to ensure that no user accounts are part of the Remote Desktop Users group. Restrict this user right to the Administrators group, and possibly the Remote Desktop Users group, to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to computers on your network by means of the Remote Assistance feature. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users."

2.2.14,2.2.14 (L1) Configure 'Create symbolic links' (Automated),Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Create symbolic links,SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege,local_group_policy,"This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators and (when the Hyper-V feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines."

If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist: • The access token that is being impersonated is for this user. • The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token. • The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.
