7.3 Ensure Database Backups are Encrypted (Automated),Ensure Database Backups are Encrypted,null,"SQL Server backups need to 'Back up to a new media set', not 'Back up to the existing media set' in order to allow for encryption. The backup option to Encrypt Backup can be implemented after a Certificate or Asymmetric key has been applied to the SQL Server for this purpose. 
Alternatively, encrypt the database with TDE. This automatically encrypts the backups as well. See 7.5"
7.5 Ensure Databases are Encrypted with TDE (Automated),Ensure user databases are encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). Backups of databases encrypted with TDE are automatically encrypted as well.,null,"Implement TDE encryption on each user database with sensitive data.
